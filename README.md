# Artificial Intelligence (CE)

## University of Tehran — Spring 2025

### Course Overview
This repository serves as a **course hub** for the Artificial Intelligence course offered in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Tehran (Spring 2025).

The course focuses on the **implementation of classical and modern AI algorithms**, with emphasis on problem-solving, algorithmic reasoning, and practical experimentation.

### Topics Covered
- Uninformed and informed search (BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, A*)
- Game-playing algorithms (Minimax)
- Genetic algorithms
- Decision tree classification
- Neural networks (FCNN, CNN)
- Unsupervised learning and clustering

---

## Course Assignments

Each assignment is implemented in a **separate repository**, linked below.

| Assignment | Focus Area | Repository |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **CA1** | State-Space Search (BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, A\*) | [ai-state-space-search](https://github.com/Parsa-Saeednia/ai-state-space-search) |
| **CA2** | Genetic Algorithms & Minimax | [ai-evolutionary-adverserial-search](https://github.com/Parsa-Saeednia/ai-evolutionary-adversarial-search) |
| **CA3** | Decision Tree Classification | [ce-ai-decision-trees](https://github.com/Parsa-Saeednia/ai-student-performance-classification) |
| **CA4** | Neural Networks (FCNN & CNN) | `ce-ai-neural-nets` |
